            <h2>A Brief Note of Support Regarding the Violence in Israel and Gaza</h2>
            <p>CAPS extends its support to all our students who are being impacted by the current violence in Israel and Gaza. We recognize the understandable grief, fear, and anger that many of our students may be experiencing right now, especially our students who are Israeli, Palestinian, or have ties to or loved ones in those regions. We encourage all of you to take care of and be compassionate with yourselves and each other; it is in times like these that we can come together as a community, and in fact, we need to.</p>
